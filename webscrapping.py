# Initialize a web browser (e.g., Chrome)
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Navigate to a job search website (e.g., LinkedIn)
driver.get("https://www.linkedin.com/jobs")

# Use Selenium to interact with the website, perform searches, and filter results
# You'll need to inspect the website's HTML structure to locate and interact with elements
# Example: enter search keywords, location, and click search

# Extract job listings from the search results using BeautifulSoup

# Loop through the listings to filter out recruiter posts and gather required information

# Save the job information to a data structure or export it directly to a Google Sheet

# Close the browser when done
